    #### Problem Statement 
    The objective here is to predict the customer satisfaction score for a given order based on features like order status, price, payment, etc. I will be using the [ZenML](https://zenml.io/) framework to build a production-ready pipeline to predict the customer satisfaction score for the next order or purchase.

    #### Description of Features 
    This app is designed to predict the customer satisfaction score for a given customer. You can input the features of the product listed below and get the customer satisfaction score. 
    | Models        | Description   | 
    | ------------- | -     | 
    | Payment Sequential | Customer may pay an order with more than one payment method. If he does so, a sequence will be created to accommodate all payments. | 
    | Payment Installments   | Number of installments chosen by the customer. |  
    | Payment Value |       Total amount paid by the customer. | 
    | Price |       Price of the product. |
    | Frieght Value |    Frieght value of the product.  | 
    | Product Name length |    Length of the product name. |
    | Product Description length |    Length of the product description. |
    | Product photos Quantity |    Number of product published photos |
    | Product weight measured in grams |    Weight of the product measured in grams. | 
    | Product length (CMs) |    Length of the product measured in centimeters. |
    | Product height (CMs) |    Height of the product measured in centimeters. |
    | Product width (CMs) |    Width of the product measured in centimeters. |
